# workflow-activerecord

**ActiveRecord/Rails Integration for the Workflow library**

To use `workflow` with a Rails 5.0 project you now need to include

    gem 'workflow-activerecord'

This will also automatically include the newest version of the core
'workflow' gem. But you can also choose a specific version:

    gem 'workflow', '~> 2.0'
    gem 'workflow-activerecord'
